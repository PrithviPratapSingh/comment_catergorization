So there is no way for me to plug it in here in the US unless I go by a converter.
"Good case, Excellent value."
Great for the jawbone.
Tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutes.MAJOR PROBLEMS!!
The mic is great.
I have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume.
"If you have several dozen or several hundred contacts, then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one."
If you are Razr owner...you must have this!
"Needless to say, I wasted my money."
What a waste of money and time!.
And the sound quality is great.
He was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery.
If the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset.
Very good quality though
"The design is very odd, as the ear ""clip"" is not very comfortable at all."
Highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone.
I advise EVERYONE DO NOT BE FOOLED!
So Far So Good!.
Works great!.
It clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last.
"I went on Motorola's website and followed all directions, but could not get it to pair again."
I bought this to use with my Kindle Fire and absolutely loved it!
The commercials are the most misleading.
I have yet to run this new battery below two bars and that's three days without charging.
I bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery.
Great Pocket PC / phone combination.
I've owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that it's the best mobile phone I've had.
I didn't think that the instructions provided were helpful to me.
People couldnt hear me talk and I had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone.
Doesn't hold charge.
"This is a simple little phone to use, but the breakage is unacceptible."
This product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive.
It is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed.
I have two more years left in this contract and I hate this phone.
Car charger as well as AC charger are included to make sure you never run out of juice.Highy recommended
You need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phone.Battery life is short.
It has kept up very well.
Poor Talk Time Performance.
The case is great and works fine with the 680.
worthless product.
"It has a great camera thats 2MP, and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality."
I was not impressed by this product.
Nice headset priced right.
I only hear garbage for audio.
Excellent bluetooth headset.
It has all the features I want
